## ðŸ”¥ Firewalls

Firewalls act as barriers between trusted internal networks and untrusted external networks, controlling traffic based on security rules.

### Types of Firewalls

- **Packet-filtering firewalls** - Basic filtering based on IP addresses and ports
- **Stateful inspection firewalls** - Track active connections for more intelligent filtering
- **Proxy firewalls** - Act as intermediaries between end-users and requested resources
- **Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)** - Include additional features like intrusion prevention

### Example iptables Rules

```bash
# Allow established connections
iptables -A INPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Allow SSH
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow HTTP and HTTPS
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Default deny policy
iptables -P INPUT DROP
iptables -P FORWARD DROP
```
